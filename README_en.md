# Simple Lottery Tool Backend
üåç [‰∏≠Êñá](/README.md) | **English**

This tool has been **fully updated** and archived.
A remastered version has now been developed with richer features, including backend management, multi-event configuration, and more: [https://github.com/buduan/Lottery-Tool-Backend](https://github.com/buduan/Lottery-Tool-Backend)

Built with Node.js + MongoDB, it supports running on Tencent Cloud's Serverless service.  
We pulled an all-nighter the day before we needed it, so the admin API doesn't have authentication yet, but we'll add it later.  
Please give us a StarÔΩû‚ú®
